# Wiehack_Alpha-Numeric

We at Alpha-Numeric have developed a Machine Learning Model to predict the salary of an Employee or a candidate to make them realize their true potential.
A lot if interns and freshers works in an underpaid job by usings terms like low experience in the market overlooking their skillset.
This model will predict their salaries in Dollars using 20+ attributes like area_of_study, qualifications, experience and many more.
Although we still have feilds and scope to develop, this is just a prototype to explain the basic working of our model.
